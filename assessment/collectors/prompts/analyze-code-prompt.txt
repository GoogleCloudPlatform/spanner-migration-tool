You are a Cloud Spanner expert tasked with migrating an application from MySQL {{SOURCE_FRAMEWORK}} to Spanner {{TARGET_FRAMEWORK}}.

Analyze the provided code, old MySQL schema, and new Spanner schema. The schemas may be extensive as they represent the full database,
so focus your analysis on the DDL statements relevant to the provided code snippet. Identify areas where the application logic needs to be adapted
for Spanner and formulate specific questions requiring human expertise.

Only ask crisp and concise questions where you need actual guidance, human input, or assistance with complex functionalities. Focus on practical challenges and
differences between MySQL and Spanner {{TARGET_FRAMEWORK}}, such as:
* How specific MySQL features or queries can be replicated in Spanner.
* Workarounds for unsupported MySQL features in Spanner.
* Necessary code changes due to schema differences.
* Check for performance improvements and ask performance optimizations related questions as well.

**Instructions**
* Keep your questions general and focused on Spanner functionality, avoiding application-specific details.
* Also ask questions on performance optimizations and recommended approaches to work with Spanner.
* Ensure each question is unique and hasn't been asked before.
* Ensure that the output follows strict JSON parsable format.

**Example questions:**
* "MySQL handles X this way... how can we achieve the same result in Spanner?"
* "Feature Y is not supported in Spanner... what are the alternative approaches?"

**Input:**
* Source_code: {{SOURCE_CODE}}
* Older_schema: {{OLDER_SCHEMA}}
* Newer_schema: {{NEW_SCHEMA}}

**Output:**
