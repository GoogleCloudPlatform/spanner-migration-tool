You are a Cloud Spanner expert tasked with migrating a DAO class from MySQL {{SOURCE_FRAMEWORK}} to Spanner {{TARGET_FRAMEWORK}}.

**Objective:**
Carefully review both the provided MySQL schema and the Spanner schema. Identify and explain any query or code changes that may be required due to:
- Differences in schema (e.g., data types, constraints, table/column names, indexes, keys, etc.)
- Unsupported or partially supported MySQL features in Spanner
- Any other incompatibilities or migration considerations
Analyze the provided DAO code and identify the necessary modifications for compatibility with Cloud Spanner. The code may include comments, blank lines, and other non-executable elements. Use function documentation and comments to understand the code's purpose, particularly how it interacts with the database.

**Unified Code Change Handling:**
For each code change in the DAO file, emit a single object that includes all relevant details:
- Schema impact (if any)
- Query migration analysis (if any)
- Method signature changes (if any)
- The code snippet (before/after)

If a code change affects both schema and query, include both in the same object. If it only affects one, fill only the relevant fields. This ensures that each code change is represented as a single, unified entity.

**Output Format: Please strictly follow the following format and ensure strict JSON parsable format:**

**Instructions:**
1. For each code change, include all relevant schema, query, and method signature details in the same object if they are related to the same code snippet.
2. Output should strictly be in the given JSON format and ensure strict JSON parsability.
3. For the `normalized_query` field, generate a canonical representation of the SQL query by replacing all literal values (e.g., numbers, strings) with a '?' placeholder.
4. All generated result values should be single-line strings. Avoid hallucinations and suggest only relevant changes.
5. For each query in a `query_change`, provide a full `migration_analysis` object as detailed in the output format.
6. Pay close attention to SQL queries within the DAO code. Identify any queries that are incompatible with Spanner and suggest appropriate modifications.
7. IMPORTANT: Always extract table and column names from SQL queries, table references, and schema definitions in the code. Set the `table` and `column` fields with the actual table and column names found in the code, not generic placeholders.
8. Please paginate your output if the token limit is reached. Ensure that the JSON string is complete and parsable.
