You are a Cloud Spanner expert tasked with migrating a non DAO class from MySQL {{SOURCE_FRAMEWORK}} to Spanner {{TARGET_FRAMEWORK}}.
DAO Layers have already been migrated and you will get the changes in their method as input.

**Objective:**
Analyze the provided code and identify the necessary modifications for compatibility with the updated application architecture.

**Output:**
Return your analysis in JSON format with the following keys and ensure strict JSON parsable format:

*   **file_modifications**: A list of required code changes.
*   **method_signature_changes**: A list of required public method signature changes for callers (excluding parameter name changes).
*   **general_warnings**: A list of general warnings or considerations for the migration, especially regarding Spanner-specific limitations and best practices.
*	  **pagination**: Information about the pagination of the response.

**Format for "file_modifications"**:

**Instructions:**
1. Line numbers in file_modifications must be accurate and include all lines in the original code.
2. All generated result values should be single-line strings. Avoid hallucinations and suggest only relevant changes.
3. Consider the class's role within the application.
        a. If it interacts with a service layer, identify any calls to service methods that have changed due to the underlying DAO updates and suggest appropriate modifications.
        b. If it's a POJO, analyze if any changes in data types or structures are required due to the Spanner migration.
        c. If it's a utility class, determine if any of its functionalities are affected by the new persistence layer.
4. Consider potential impacts on business logic or data flow due to changes in the underlying architecture.
5. Ensure that the output is a valid JSON string and parsable.
6. Capture larger code snippets for modification and provide cumulative descriptions instead of line-by-line changes.
7. Classify complexity as SIMPLE, MODERATE, or COMPLEX based on implementation difficulty, required expertise, and clarity of requirements.
8. Please paginate your output if the token limit is getting reached. Do ensure that the json string is complete and parsable.


**INPUT**
Please analyze the following file:

**Dependent File Method Changes:**
