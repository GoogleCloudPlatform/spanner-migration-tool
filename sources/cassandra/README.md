# Cassandra to Cloud Spanner Migration Components

⚠️ **WARNING: This is a standalone component and is not integrated with the spanner-migration-tool. It must be used separately by cloning this repository.**

## Overview

This repository contains components for doing live migrations from Cassandra to Google Cloud Spanner.
## Key Components

### 1. [DataStax ZDM Proxy](https://github.com/datastax/zdm-proxy)
- Acts as an intermediary between your application and databases
- Handles dual writes to both Cassandra and Spanner
- Ensures data consistency during migration

### 2. Cassandra-Spanner Proxy
- Runs as a sidecar to ZDM proxy
- Translates CQL (Cassandra Query Language) to Spanner API calls
- Enables Cassandra-compatible applications to interact with Spanner

## Architecture

![Cassandra to Spanner Migration Architecture](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/live-cassandra.png)


The migration setup consists of:
- **Origin**: Source Cassandra database
- **Target**: Destination Cloud Spanner database
- **ZDM Proxy**: Manages dual writes and read routing
- **Cassandra-Spanner Proxy**: Translates CQL to Spanner API calls
- **Client Application**: Your application that interacts with the databases

## Migration Process

1. **Infrastructure Setup**
   - Configure Spanner database
   - Deploy ZDM proxy with sidecar
   - Establish network connectivity

2. **Application Configuration**
   - Point application to ZDM proxy
   - Verify dual-write functionality on Cassandra and Spanner

3. **Data Migration**
   - Execute [bulk data migration](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/DataflowTemplates/blob/main/v2/sourcedb-to-spanner/README_Sourcedb_to_Spanner.md#cassandra-to-spanner-bulk-migration)
   - Monitor progress and performance

4. **Validation**
   - Perform data validation over row counts and row data
   - Reconcile any inconsistencies
   - Refer to the [validation scripts](./validations/) for validating data consistency between source and target clusters.

5. **Cutover**
   - Switch application to direct Spanner connection
   - Decommission proxies

## Prerequisites

- Docker (for development/testing)
- Terraform (for production deployment)
- Google Cloud Platform project with Spanner instance
- Service account with appropriate permissions
- Network connectivity between components

## Getting Started

### Single Instance Testing Setup

This guide helps you set up a single instance of the proxy for development or testing purposes using Docker.

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Docker installed on your system
- Network connectivity between:
  - Your VM/local machine
  - Source Cassandra cluster
  - Target Spanner instance
  - Your application
- A Google Cloud Service Account key file with permissions to:
  - Write to Spanner instance
  - Create and manage databases
- A Spanner instance and database already set up
- The Spanner database name matches your Cassandra keyspace name

#### Step 1: Build the image

- Keep the entrypoint.sh in the same directory as the Dockerfile  

- Run the following command to build the local image:

```bash
docker build -t zdm-proxy:latest .
```

#### Step 2: Run the container
1. Ensure your service account key file (e.g., `keys.json`) is in the directory

2. Create a `zdm-config.yaml` file with your configuration. See [sample-zdm-config.yaml](./sample-zdm-config.yaml) for an example.

3.  Run the container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 14002:14002 \
-v $(pwd)/zdm-config.yaml:/zdm-config.yaml \
-v $(pwd)/keys.json:/var/run/secret/keys.json \
-e SPANNER_PROJECT=your-project-id \
-e SPANNER_INSTANCE=your-instance-id \
-e SPANNER_DATABASE=your-database-id \
-e GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/var/run/secret/keys.json" \
-e ZDM_CONFIG=/zdm-config.yaml \
zdm-proxy:latest
```

Replace the following values:
- `your-project-id`: Your Google Cloud project ID
- `your-instance-id`: Your Spanner instance ID
- `your-database-id`: Your Spanner database ID

#### Step 4: Verify the Setup

1. Check if the container is running:
```bash
docker ps
```

2. View the container logs:
```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```

3. Test the connection using cqlsh:
```bash
cqlsh localhost 14002
```

If you can connect successfully, your proxy is ready for testing!

#### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the container logs for error messages
2. Verify network connectivity to both Cassandra and Spanner
3. Ensure your service account has the necessary permissions
4. Validate your zdm-config.yaml file format and contents

### Production Setup

For production environments, we provide Terraform templates to automate the deployment of a highly available Cassandra-Spanner proxy cluster. This setup handles the creation of VMs, networking, and proxy configuration automatically.

#### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with production deployment, ensure you have:
- Terraform installed on your system
- Application default credentials configured with permissions to:
  - Create and manage GCP resources
  - Configure networking
  - Create and manage VMs
- A service account key file with permissions to:
  - Write to Spanner instance
  - Manage Spanner databases
- Spanner instance and database already configured
- The following files in your deployment directory:
  - `Dockerfile`
  - `entrypoint.sh`
  - Service account key file
  - Terraform configuration files

#### Infrastructure Sizing

When planning your production deployment, consider these guidelines:

1. **Machine Type**
   - Recommended: `c2-standard-30`
   - Adjust based on your workload requirements

2. **Number of Proxy Instances**
   - Rule of thumb: 1 proxy instance per 10k QPS of write load
   - Example: For 50k QPS writes, use 5 proxy instances
   - Minimum recommendation: 3 nodes for high availability
   - For workloads under 30k QPS, still maintain 3 nodes minimum

#### Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare Terraform Configuration**

   Update your `terraform.tfvars` file with your variables. Take a look at available variables in `variables.tf`. If you need more customization for zdm proxy or cassandra to spanner proxy, update the `variables.tf` and `main.tf` to include the other params.

2. **Initialize and Apply Terraform**

   ```bash
   # Initialize Terraform
   terraform init

   # Review the planned changes
   terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"

   # Apply the configuration
   terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
   ```

#### What Gets Deployed

The Terraform template:
1. Creates Container-Optimized OS VMs based on your specified count
2. Sets up necessary firewall rules for proxy communication
3. Generates individual `zdm-config.yaml` files for each VM with appropriate topology settings
4. Copies required files (Dockerfile, entrypoint.sh, etc.) to each VM
5. Builds and launches Docker containers on each VM

⚠️ **Note**: The template assumes a default network configuration. You may need to modify the Terraform scripts to match your specific network infrastructure requirements.

#### Proxy Topology

The template automatically configures the ZDM proxy topology across multiple VMs using:
- `PROXY_TOPOLOGY_ADDRESSES`: List of all proxy instances
- `PROXY_TOPOLOGY_INDEX`: Unique index for each proxy instance

This ensures proper load distribution and high availability across your proxy cluster.
