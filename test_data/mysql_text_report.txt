Summary of Conversion
----------------------------
Schema conversion: POOR (29% of 17006 columns mapped cleanly) + some missing primary keys.
Data conversion: POOR (66% of 6000 rows written to Spanner).

The remainder of this report provides stats on the mysqldump statements
processed, followed by a table-by-table listing of SCHEMA_AND_DATA conversion
details. For background on the SCHEMA_AND_DATA conversion process used, and
explanations of the terms and notes used in this report, see Spanner migration
tool's README.

----------------------------
Statements Processed
----------------------------
Analysis of statements in mysqldump output, broken down by statement type.
  schema: statements successfully processed for Spanner schema information.
    data: statements successfully processed for data.
    skip: statements not relevant for Spanner schema or data.
   error: statements that could not be processed.

No Name Changes in Migration
----------------------------
Table bad_schema
----------------------------
Schema conversion: POOR ( 0% of 2 columns mapped cleanly) + missing primary key.
Data conversion: OK (94% of 1000 rows written to Spanner).

Warnings
1) Table 'bad_schema': Some columns will consume more storage in Spanner e.g. for
   column 'a', source DB type float is mapped to Spanner data type float64.
2) Column 'synth_id' was added because table 'bad_schema' didn't have a primary
   key. Spanner requires a primary key for every table.

----------------------------
Table default_value
----------------------------
Schema conversion: EXCELLENT (100% of 2 columns mapped cleanly).
Data conversion: NONE (100% of 0 rows written to Spanner).

Note
1) Some columns have default values which Spanner migration tool does not
   migrate. Please add the default constraints manually after the migration is
   complete for table 'default_value' e.g. column 'b'.

----------------------------
Table excellent_schema
----------------------------
Schema conversion: EXCELLENT (100% of 2 columns mapped cleanly).
Data conversion: NONE (100% of 0 rows written to Spanner).

----------------------------
Table foreign_key
----------------------------
Schema conversion: EXCELLENT (100% of 2 columns mapped cleanly).
Data conversion: NONE (100% of 0 rows written to Spanner).

----------------------------
Table no_pk
----------------------------
Schema conversion: POOR (33% of 3 columns mapped cleanly) + missing primary key.
Data conversion: POOR (60% of 5000 rows written to Spanner).

Warnings
1) Table 'no_pk': Some columns will consume more storage in Spanner e.g. for
   column 'b', source DB type int(11) is mapped to Spanner data type int64.
2) Column 'synth_id' was added because table 'no_pk' didn't have a primary key.
   Spanner requires a primary key for every table.

Unexpected Conditions
----------------------------
For debugging only. This section provides details of unexpected conditions
encountered as we processed the mysqldump data. In particular, the AST node
representation used by the pingcap/tidb/parser library used for parsing
mysqldump output is highly permissive: almost any construct can appear at
any node in the AST tree. The list details all unexpected nodes and
conditions.
