# Setting up source database details
{: .no_toc }

This is required only in case of [session file connection mechanism](../connect-source.md/#load-session-file). In this case Spanner migration tool needs the source database details to perform data migration. While specifying the source database details, the user can either use **direct connection** or **dump file** connection mechanism and specify the required parameters to connect to the source database. Once the user clicks on save, Spanner migration tool shows error or success depending on the status of their connection.
