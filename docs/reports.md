# Files Generated by Spanner migration tool
{: .no_toc }

Spanner migration tool generates several files as it runs. Each of the file have their own function, from storing an existing migration state to generating a report for the schema analyzed by it. Below is a description of each.

## File descriptions

- Schema file (ending in `schema.txt`): contains the generated Spanner
  schema, interspersed with comments that cross-reference to the relevant
  source schema definitions.

- Session file (ending in `session.json`): contains all schema and data
  conversion state endcoded as JSON. It is basically a snapshot of the session.

- Structured Report file (ending in `structured_report.json`): contains a JSON based
structured analysis of the source to Spanner migration. The structured report can be
used to in-depth analysis of Spanner migration tool findings via BI tools. For a detailed
description of each element of a report, refer to [Elements of a Report](/internal/reports/REPORT.md).

- Text Report file (ending in `report.txt`): contains a detailed analysis of the
  source to Spanner migration, including table-by-table stats and an
  analysis of Source types that don't cleanly map onto Spanner types.
  Note that source types that don't have a corresponding Spanner type
  are mapped to STRING(MAX).

- Bad data file (ending in `dropped.txt`): contains details of data
  that could not be converted and written to Spanner, including sample
  bad-data rows. If there is no bad-data, this file is not written (and we
  delete any existing file with the same name from a previous run).

By default, these files are prefixed by the name of the Spanner database (with a
dot separator). The file prefix can be overridden using the `-prefix`
[option](#options).

## Spanner migration tool report

### Conversion Metdata

Defines the total time taken to perform the conversion. This may include other conversion related metadata in the future.

### Statement Stats

Statistics on different types of statements identified by the Spanner migration tool. This is only populated when processing dump files.

### Name Changes
