# SMT Operation modes
{: .no_toc }

SMT supports two modes of operations:

- **UI** - SMT ships with the web-based UI which can launched via `web` command. The UI supports schema and data migrations, and is the recommended way to use SMT.
- **CLI** - SMT ships with three stand-alone CLI commands - `schema`, `data` and `schema-and-data`. These commands can be used with appropriate parameters to perform schema and data migrations.
