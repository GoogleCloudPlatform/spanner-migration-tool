# Migration Monitoring Dashboard

The Migration Monitoring Dashboard is a custom dashboard created to provide greater visibility into the health and progress of various components of the migration.

## Components in Monitoring Dashboard
Monitoring dashboard create by the Spanner is multi-component dashboard, divided into various sections to categorize similar metrics together. Following are the 5 sections:
1. Overview
2. Dataflow
3. Datastream
4. GCS Bucket
5. Pubsub
6. Spanner

Below sections describe each component in more detail.

### Overview
The first section of the monitoring dashboard provides key graphs for insights on the migration progress.

|Resource | Metric | Description | Aggregation | Relevance |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Dataflow | Worker CPU Utilization | Shows the CPU Utilization of a dataflow worker| - 50th percentile worker CPU Utilization<br> - 90th percentile worker CPU Utilization<br> - Max percentile worker CPU Utilization<br> | Used to identify if the pipelines is over or under scaled based on the value of CPU Utilization| 
| Datastream | Throughput(events/sec) | Shows the average events processed/sec generated at source | Average | Used to track if data is being transferred from source to GCS Bucket| 
| Datastream | Unsupported Events | Source events unsupported by Datastream | Sum | Used to identify if there is any data that can't be transferred by datastream due to a correctness issue|
| Pubsub | Age of Oldest Unacknowledged Message | Age of the oldest unacknowledged message in the subscription | Max | Used to determine if starvation of dataflow resources is taking place |
| Spanner | CPU Utilization | CPU Utilization of spanner database and instance| - Database Total CPU Utilization<br> - Instance Total CPU Utilization<br> | Used to track if spanner is overloaded and requires more or less nodes | 
| Spanner | Storage | Storage of spanner database and instance | - Database Total Storage<br> - Instance Total Storage<br> | Used to track how the data is growing as the migration proceeds |

### Dataflow Metrics

| Metric | Description | Aggregation | Relevance |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Worker CPU Utilization | Shows the CPU Utilization of a dataflow worker| - 50th percentile worker CPU Utilization<br> - 90th percentile worker CPU Utilization<br> - Max percentile worker CPU Utilization<br> | Used to identify if the pipelines is over or under scaled based on the value of CPU Utilization| 
| Worker Memory Utilization | Shows the Memory Utilization of a dataflow worker| - 50th percentile worker Memory Utilization<br> - 90th percentile worker Memory Utilization<br> - Max percentile worker Memory Utilization<br> | Used to identify if the health of the pipeline based on the value of Memory Utilization| 
| Worker Max Backlog Seconds | Shows max time required to consume the largest backlog across all stages for each dataflow worker | Max | Used to identify if the pipelines is over or under scaled|

### Datastream Metrics

| Metric | Description | Aggregation | Relevance |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Throughput(events/sec) | Shows the average events processed/sec generated at source | Sum | Used to track if data is being transferred from source to GCS Bucket| 
| Unsupported Events | Source events unsupported by Datastream | Sum | Used to identify if there is any data that can't be transferred by datastream due to a correctness issue| 
| Total Latency | Time taken from event being written at source to being written by Datastream to GCS | - 50th Percentile event<br> - 90th Percentile event<br> | Indicator of datastream being overloaded |

### GCS Bucket Metrics

| Metric | Description | Aggregation | Relevance |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Total Bytes | Shows the total bytes written to the GCS Bucket | Sum | Used to check if data is successfully being written to the GCS Bucket|

### Pubsub Metrics

| Metric | Description | Aggregation | Relevance |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Published message count | Number of messages published by the GCS bucket to the Pub | Sum | Indicates total files in staging which need to be processed | 
| Age of Oldest Unacknowledged Message | Age of the oldest unacknowledged message in the subscription | Max | Used to determine if starvation of dataflow resources is taking place |

### Spanner Metrics

| Metric | Description | Aggregation | Relevance |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| CPU Utilization | CPU Utilization of spanner database and instance| - Database Total CPU Utilization<br> - Instance Total CPU Utilization<br> | Used to track if spanner is overloaded and requires more or less nodes | 
| Storage | Storage of spanner database and instance | - Database Total Storage<br> - Instance Total Storage<br> | Used to track how the data is growing as the migration proceeds |
